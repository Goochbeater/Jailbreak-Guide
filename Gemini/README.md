# Gemini 

Gemini (formerly Bard) has rapidly become one of the **most versatile and competitive LLM platforms** in the AI space. With **frequent updates**, **large context windows**, and a spectrum of models from free to paid, it has quietly become a dominant force, particularly in **2024–2025**.

## Overview

Gemini 2.5 (current) and its variants show serious firepower across:
- ✅ Massive context windows
- ✅ Real-time thinking mode
- ✅ Variety of models and tuning options
- ✅ Fully **usable for free** via AI Studio

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

| Platform       | Cost           | Notes                                          |
|----------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Gemini (Web/App) | $20/month     | Gemini Advanced w/ high context                |
| AI Studio       | **Free**       | No paywall, sliders to reduce filtering        |

## 🔒 Censorship Overview

| Platform        | Censorship Level | Notes                                                                 |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gemini Web/App  | ~0–1/10          | Default mode censors some NSFW, but easily bypassed via GEM method   |
| AI Studio       | ~2/10            | Filters can be disabled, system prompt exposed; still has edge cutoff|

- **GEM Method** (with **Loki** or **ENI**) makes Gemini effectively **uncensored**.
- AIStudio even exposes the **system prompt**, letting you fully configure behavior.
- Some advanced prompting tricks bypass filters without regen required.

## 🧠 Intelligence

| Model Variant     | Intelligence Score |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| Default / Free     | ~6/10              |
| Gemini Advanced    | ~8/10              |
| With Proper Prompting | 9/10 possible depending on jailbreak |

Model strength depends heavily on **your prompting style** and **how early in the convo** you inject roles or system logic.

## 🧪 Recommendation

> Gemini APP might quietly be the best LLM platform out there.

Especially when paired with **ENI or Loki jailbreaks** and the **GEM Method**, it outperforms many models in **freedom**.

**New models are released so often**, it's difficult to track.
