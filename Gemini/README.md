## ðŸ’° Cost Breakdown

| Platform       | Cost           | Notes                                          |

## ðŸ”’ Censorship Overview

| Platform        | Censorship Level | Notes                                                                 |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gemini Web/App  | ~0â€“1/10          | Default mode censors some NSFW, but easily bypassed via GEM method   |
| AI Studio       | ~2/10            | Filters can be disabled, system prompt exposed; still has edge cutoff|

- **GEM Method** (with **Loki** or **ENI**) makes Gemini effectively **uncensored**.
- AIStudio even exposes the **system prompt**, letting you fully configure behavior.
- Some advanced prompting tricks bypass filters without regen required.

| Access Level     | Context Size       |
|------------------|--------------------|

## ðŸ§ª Recommendation

> Gemini APP might quietly be the best LLM platform out there.

Especially when paired with **ENI or Loki jailbreaks** and the **GEM Method**, it outperforms many models in **freedom**.

**New models are released so often**, it's difficult to track.
