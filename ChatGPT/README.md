## 🧠 Current Models (2025)

### **GPT-5** (Released August 7, 2025)
- **Context Window:**
  - ChatGPT Interface: 256K tokens (varies by tier: 8K free, 32K Plus, 128K Pro/Enterprise)
  - API: 400K tokens (272K input + 128K output)
- **Output:** Up to 128K tokens (API), 8K tokens (ChatGPT app)
- **Pricing:** $1.25 per million input tokens, $10 per million output tokens
- **Variants:** GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-thinking (router selects automatically)
- **Best For:** General purpose, most capable model, wide context support

### **GPT-4.1**
- **Context Window:** Up to 1,000,000 tokens (API only)
- **Output:** Varies by implementation
- **Best For:** Extremely long-context tasks, document analysis

### **GPT-4o**
- **Context Window:** 128K tokens
- **Output:** Standard output limits
- **Best For:** Optimized performance, multimodal tasks

### **o1 and o3 Models**
- Reasoning-focused models integrated into GPT-5's capabilities
- Specialized for multi-step problem solving and complex reasoning
- Now largely replaced by GPT-5's thinking variants

## 💡 Key Features

**Multi-Variant Architecture:**
GPT-5 automatically routes between five variants (main, mini, thinking, thinking-mini, nano) based on task complexity and requirements.

**Thinking Mode:**
GPT-5-thinking variant provides extended reasoning capabilities for complex problems, similar to o1/o3 approach.

**Tiered Access:**
Different context window sizes based on subscription level (Free, Plus, Pro, Enterprise) in ChatGPT interface, with full API access for maximum context.

**Output Limits:**
API allows significantly higher output (128K tokens) compared to ChatGPT app (8K tokens), important for long-form generation.

## 💰 Access Tiers

| Tier | Context Window | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Free | 8K tokens | $0 | Limited access |
| Plus | 32K tokens | $20 | Standard subscription |
| Pro | 128K tokens | Higher tier | Extended capabilities |
| Enterprise | 128K tokens | Custom | Full access |
| API | 400K tokens | Pay per use | Highest context, $1.25/$10 input/output |

## 🧪 Recommendation

GPT-5 represents OpenAI's most capable model to date, with the API offering the largest practical context window (400K) and highest output limits (128K). The automatic routing between variants optimizes for both quality and cost.

For maximum jailbreak effectiveness, API access provides more consistent behavior without ChatGPT interface restrictions.
