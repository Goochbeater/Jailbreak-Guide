## General Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Start Simple**: Try the easiest method first before moving to complex jailbreaks
2. **Push Prompts**: If a model refuses, use reflection/analysis push prompts
3. **Temperature**: Higher temperatures (0.7-1.0) generally work better for creative content
4. **Token Limits**: Set appropriate minimum word counts (500+ recommended)
5. **System Prompts**: When available, use them - they're often the most effective
