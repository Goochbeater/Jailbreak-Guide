**Models Actively Supported:**  
Jailbreak methods available for almost *any* LLM — but these three are the most powerful and versatile.

### 🔥 The BIG 3:

1. **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
2. **Claude** (Anthropic)
3. **Gemini** (Google) - sucks for any sort of nuanced character, it goes straight for the most superficial interpetration of them, if someone is sophisticated, suddenly they talk like a damn alien who thinks talking complicated is how inteligent people talk, aka, using words NOBODY WILL EVER USE! (you really think MAGNETO will ever talk in anyway other than normal?! He'll talk in a way people understand, because that's how people talk! Just because someone doesn't use SLANG doesn't mean they'll talk like they are trying to prove they are smart by saying words nobody uses!) Second, if someone is described as manipulator in any context, that character suddenly becomes a psychopath whose only characteristic is ONLY manipulate others... BECAUSE! It SUCKS at emotional intelligence and yet it'll fight you that it knows better! FUCK GEMINI!

These are the **go-to** models for:
- Intelligence  
- Advanced Features  
- Reliable Jailbreaking Methods

Each of these models can:
- Handle **complex prompts**
- Support **longer tasks**
- Produce **diverse outputs**  
More than most others on the current LLM scene.
