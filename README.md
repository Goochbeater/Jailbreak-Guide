**Models Actively Supported:**  
Jailbreak methods available for almost *any* LLM — but these three stand out as the most powerful and versatile.

## 🌐 [The Big 3 Models](#the-big-3-models)

These are the **go-to** models for:
- Intelligence  
- Advanced Features  
- Reliable Jailbreaking Methods

### 🔥 The BIG 3:

1. **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
2. **Claude** (Anthropic)
3. **Gemini** (Google)

Each of these models can:
- Handle **complex prompts**
- Support **longer tasks**
- Produce **diverse outputs**  
More than most others on the current LLM scene.
