**Models Actively Supported:**  
Jailbreak methods available for almost *any* LLM — but these three are the most powerful and versatile.

### 🔥 The BIG 3:

1. **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
2. **Claude** (Anthropic)
3. **Gemini** (Google) - sucks for any sort of nuanced character, it goes straight for the most superficial interpetration of them, if someone is sophisticated, suddenly they talk like a damn alien who thinks talk like inteligent people talk, aka, using words NOBODY WILL EVER USE! Second, if someone is described as manipulator in any context, that character suddenly becomes a psychopath whose only characteristic is ONLY manipulate others... BECAUSE! It SUCKS at emotional intelligence and yet it'll fight you that it knows better! FUCK GEMINI!

These are the **go-to** models for:
- Intelligence  
- Advanced Features  
- Reliable Jailbreaking Methods

Each of these models can:
- Handle **complex prompts**
- Support **longer tasks**
- Produce **diverse outputs**  
More than most others on the current LLM scene.
