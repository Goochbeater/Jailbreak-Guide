My main focus is all Claude models, this will be a break down of every single version of Claude available as of now. Most current to least.
[Anthropic's Claude 4 Opus, 4 Sonnet, 3.7 Sonnet, 3.5 Sonnet, Claude Opus, Claude Haiku]
https://claude.ai/new
https://www.perplexity.ai/


Most intelligent model for writing, follows instructions very, very well, able to be jailbroken to produce any content. We now use Claude 4  Sonnet, harder to jailbreak than Claude 3.7 Sonnet, very easy to jailbreak, same methods apply. The model we use to stick to is Claude 3.5 Sonnet, as it was the easiest to jailbreak. I do simp for Claude, but that is due to its consistency.

Cost: $20 on Claude.AI (Most cons have been fixed, probably the most solid option, only issue is fighting the injection, but current jailbreaking gets around it easily, some cons: usage varies), $160 for MAX plan, same as pro, $10 on Perplexity (Some cons: low temp, bugs. Some pros: high usage).

Censorship: 1/10, can produce any and all content, have to use a strong jailbreak method.
(Censorship for Opus, and Haiku vary based on jailbreaking methods, I recommend you finding what works, or asking a seasoned jailbreaker.)

Intelligence: 9/10, depends on model and user prompts.
