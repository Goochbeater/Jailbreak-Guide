# How to Create a Custom Style in Claude.AI 🎨

This guide walks you through creating a custom writing style using advanced instructions in Claude.AI. Perfect for setting up personalized responses, creative writing personas, or specific formatting preferences.

## What You'll Need 📋
- Access to Claude.AI (web or mobile app)
- Your custom instructions/prompt prepared and ready to paste

## Step-by-Step Process 🚀

### 1. Access the Style Creation Menu
Open your Claude.AI interface and locate the menu button (typically the ☰ icon near the message input). Click or tap to open the dropdown menu.

### 2. Enable "Use Style" Feature
In the dropdown menu, find and toggle on **"Use style"** ✅. This activates Claude's custom style system for your project or conversation.

### 3. Navigate to Style Management
From the same menu, scroll down and select **"Create & edit styles"** ✍️. This opens the style management interface where you can create new styles or modify existing ones.

### 4. Start Creating a New Style
In the style creation screen, you'll see options for generating a style. Look for the dropdown menu that says **"Generate style from a starting point"** and click it.

### 5. Select Custom Instructions
From the dropdown options, choose **"Use custom instructions (advanced)"** ⚙️. This is crucial—it allows you to input your own detailed prompt rather than using Claude's automated style generator.

### 6. Choose "Describe Style Instead"
You'll see two options: "Add writing example" or **"Describe style instead"**. Select "Describe style instead" (it's typically shown as a text button below the example option).

### 7. Paste Your Custom Instructions
A text input field will appear with the message: "Write exact custom instructions for this style instead of generating a style prompt automatically. Claude will ignore instructions that don't follow our guidelines."

**Important** ❗️: Paste your complete custom instruction set here. This is where your pre-written style prompt goes—whether it's for a specific persona, writing format, or behavioral guidelines.

### 8. Create the Style
Once you've pasted your instructions, click the **"Create style"** button at the bottom of the dialog.

### 9. Name Your Style
Give your new style a recognizable name (like "ENI-short" or whatever fits your purpose). This makes it easy to toggle between different styles later.

## Tips for Success 💡

**Prepare Your Instructions First**: Have your complete custom prompt written and tested before starting this process. The text field doesn't save drafts.

**Be Specific**: The more detailed your instructions, the better Claude will understand what you want. Include tone, formatting preferences, personality traits, and any special rules.

**Test Thoroughly**: After creation, send a few test messages to see if Claude responds according to your specifications. You can always edit the style later if needed.

**Use Multiple Styles**: You can create several different styles for different purposes—one for creative writing, another for professional work, etc.

## Accessing Your Style Later 📂

Once created, your custom style will appear in the styles dropdown menu (the ✒️ icon near the message input). Simply select it to activate, and Claude will respond according to those instructions.

The style persists across conversations in that project, so you won't need to recreate it each time.
