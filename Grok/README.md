## 💡 Key Features

**Real-Time Search Integration:**
Grok 4 Fast seamlessly browses the web and X (Twitter) to augment queries with real-time data, providing up-to-date information beyond training cutoff.

**Extended Reasoning:**
Grok 3's reinforcement learning enables extended reasoning sessions where the model corrects errors, explores alternatives, and delivers accurate answers through multi-minute thinking.

**Tool Calling:**
Grok 4.1 Fast is engineered as xAI's best tool-calling model, optimized for speed, accuracy, and enterprise applications with its 2M context window.

**Multimodal Processing:**
Comprehensive multimodal support with text currently available, vision and image-generation features expected soon.

**Cache Optimization:**
Grok 4.1 Fast offers cached input tokens at $0.05 per million (75% discount), making repeated context extremely cost-effective.

## 💰 Pricing (Grok 4.1 Fast)

| Token Type | Cost per Million |
|------------|------------------|
| Input | $0.20 |
| Cached Input | $0.05 |
| Output | $0.50 |

Extended context (>128K tokens) on Grok 4 incurs higher rates.

## 🧪 Recommendation

Grok 4.1 Fast currently holds the crown for largest production context window at 2 million tokens, making it exceptional for:
- Analyzing massive documents or codebases
- Long conversation histories
- Multi-document synthesis
- Enterprise applications requiring extensive context

The real-time search capabilities combined with frontier agentic features make Grok particularly strong for tasks requiring current information and autonomous web interaction.

For jailbreak purposes, the massive context window allows extensive system prompts and conversation history without truncation.
